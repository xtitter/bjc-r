            Sorting a List: Implementation

        We can describe the general algorithm from the last step using the following block of code:

        <br>
        <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <img hspace="0" border="0" vspace="0" src="/bjc-r/img/list/insertion-sort-code-BYOB.gif" alt="Insertion sort code" title="Insertion sort code" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab05/insertion_sort_code.gif">
        </div>

        <br>

        We have not written the <tt>move-up into position</tt> block yet; it is just a <em>stub</em>, a block without a script.

        <br>
        <br>

        The <tt>move-up into position</tt> block should take a number at a particular index (<tt>index</tt>) and swap it with the number just above it.  The block should repeat this step until that number is either at the top of the list, or it is below a smaller number.  This way, the number at <tt>index</tt> is placed into its correct position in the sorted portion of the list (check it!).  In an earlier lab, you implemented a block that <a href="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/mod/resource/view.php?id=1768">swaps two rows in a list</a>; you may find this block useful.

        <br>
        <br>

        Complete the <tt>move-up into position</tt> block so that the <tt>swap-insertion sort</tt> block works.  You can download the framework code <a href="/bjc-r/prog/BYOB/insertion-sort.ypr">here</a>.
