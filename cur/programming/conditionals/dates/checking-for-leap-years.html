            Checking for Leap Years

        <p>
            A year in our calendar is a leap year&mdash;it has 366 days&mdash;if it is either divisible, with no remainder, by
            400 or divisible by 4 but not by 100.
            Thus 2000 was a leap year (divisible by 400, 100, and 4), 1900 was not (divisible by 100 and 4), 1996 was (divisible by 4), and 1999 
            (not divisible by anything!) wasn't.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the block sets below: they all say <b>"leap year"</b>  
            if the <tt>year</tt> variable is a leap year and <b>"normal year"</b> otherwise.  That is, they all correctly
            determine if a year is a leap year.
