        In the code sample below, we have implemented a simple number-guessing game.  The computer chooses a random number and then asks the player to guess the random number.  The code is available in <a href="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab03/GuessTheNumber.sb">this file</a>.

        The game is not that cool yet, though.  In the next few steps, we are going to make the game much more like playing the number-guessing game with a person!
