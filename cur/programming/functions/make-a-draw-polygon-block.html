		<p>
			Now, you are going to make a block that takes two inputs.  We want to create a <tt>draw polygon</tt> block that takes a number of sides and  the length of each side as its inputs.  We will call these inputs <tt>sides</tt> and <tt>length</tt>.  This exercise should be done with a partner, so introduce yourself to your neighbor and get started on the exercise together.
		</p>

			You should remember from <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/intro/drawing/experiment-with-repeat.html">this lesson</a> how to draw a regular polygon. How many degrees altogether? How many turns?
