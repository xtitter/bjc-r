	</head>
	<body>

		In a previous lab, we used a <tt>repeat</tt> block to avoid duplicating code.  Similarly, we can use a custom block to avoid duplicating code.
		Below is some code to draw a tic-tac-toe board.  Your goal is to create blocks that make this code simpler.  One important thing to keep in mind is to give your new blocks really intuitive names, so that it is easy to read the code and understand what it does.
