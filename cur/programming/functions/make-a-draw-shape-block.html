	</head>
	<body>
		Now, you are going to make a block that takes two inputs.  We want to create a <tt>draw shape</tt> block that takes a number of sides and a number of pixels for the length of each side.  We will call these input arguments <tt>n</tt> and <tt>pixel</tt>.  This exercise should be done with a partner, so introduce yourself to your neighbor and get started on the exercise together!

		<br>
		<br>

		By the way, you can create the inputs to this block in exactly the same way as we did in the previous section, by clicking on the plus signs to add input; however, as a shortcut, you can also type the names of the input as shown below.
		<br>
		<br>
		<div style="margin-left:40px;"><img hspace="0" height="361" border="0" width="300" vspace="0" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/using-percent-signs-for-variables-in-block-names-BYOB.jpg" alt="Using percent signs to indicate variables" title="Using percent signs to indicate variables" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab04/DrawShape/UsingPercentSigns.jpg">
		</div>

		<br>

		The percent signs (<tt>%</tt>) indicate that the word should be an input. We want you to feel comfortable with both entry methods.

		<br>
		<br>
		Unfortunately, the size of the text field where you can type in the name of the block (and any %input shortcuts) is limited. If you find yourself running out of room, we recommend that you just name the block and use the plus signs later to add inputs.
