            Best Free Square

        There won't always be a move where you can win or block an opponent's winning move.
        So now we want to make sure that the computer will take the best free square. For example,
        it's always good to take the middle square (5) first when playing the game; if that's taken,
        then you take one of the corners. Make the <span style="font-style: italic;">best-free-square </span>
        block that takes in a triple as the input and returns the best move for the computer.

            <img hspace="0" height="77" border="0" width="338" vspace="0" src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-best-free-square-find-triples-output.png" alt="bestfreesquare" title="bestfreesquare" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab20/TTT_bestfreesquare.PNG">
            <br>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: left;">
                It would be very helpful if you also made a helper block for best-free-square that would search inside the triples and see whether or not the preferred square is available.
