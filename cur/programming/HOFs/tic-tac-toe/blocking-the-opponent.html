You made something like this before! You don't have to go through the complicated process of finding triples that have two of the opponent's letter piece and none of the computer's piece - it's already done for one way. <br><br> By using the i-can-win? block, make a <i>opponent-can-win?</i> block that takes a list of triples and a piece as inputs and returns the square that the computer should block. If there isn't, return false.
