		Often, we will want to move the character with the arrow keys (i.e. up, down, left, and right). We can use the block <tt>point in direction</tt> as shown below.
		<br>
		<div style="text-align: center;"><img width="460" vspace="0" hspace="0" height="190" border="0" title="Point in direction" alt="Point in direction" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/point-in-direction-block.png" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab03/PointInDirection.jpg">

			In the next step, you're going to want two sprites with costumes, so start with the same project you used in Topic 1:

		</p>

			There are still a few things in the Snap! user interface that you probably have not used yet. Experiment with the rotation controls shown below and make sure you understand the behavior of each. (Hint: it'll be more obvious if your sprite isn't pointing toward the right, and isn't wearing its turtle (arrow) costume.) These will probably come in handy at some point!

		<div style="text-align: center;"><img width="266" vspace="0" hspace="0" height="93" border="0" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/rotation-controls.png" alt="Rotation Controls" title="Rotation Controls" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab03/RotationControls.jpg">
			<br>
		</div>
		<br>
		Finally, make a character move around based upon the keys that you have pressed. You will need to use one of the rounded hat pieces, such as the one in the example shown below. These can respond to key presses and start a script. Use the four arrow keys to control the sprite motion.
