		It can be helpful to see which block is executing at each time. Click <tt>Edit</tt> and then <tt>Start Single Stepping</tt> to highlight the block that is executing when you run the scripts.

		<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><img border="0" width="251" vspace="0" hspace="0" height="162" src="/bjc-r/img/sys/sys-single-stepping-BYOB.jpg" alt="SingleStep" title="SingleStep" origsrc="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/file.php/17/Images/Lab01/Wait/SingleStep.jpg">

		</div>
		Now that single stepping is turned on, go back and run your "play sound [meow]" scripts from the previous page. Observe how quickly the highlighted block changes on the "play sound [meow]" and likewise how long it waits on the "play sound [meow] until done".
		<br>
		<br>
		If you no longer want single stepping on, click <tt>Edit</tt> and then <tt>Stop Single Stepping</tt>.
