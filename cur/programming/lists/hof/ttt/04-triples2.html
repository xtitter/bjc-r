  <h3> Finding the Triples (Continued) </h3>
  <p>We are working up to being able to transform the <code>wins</code> list, which is a list of lists, into a similar list but with some square numbers replaced with X and O according to the position. You started, in the last activity, by making a <code>substitute letter</code> block that transforms a single square number into the desired value for that square. Now  use that to make <code>substitute triple</code>, a block that takes a triple (a list of three numbers, one of the winning combinations) and a position as its inputs, and returns the transformed version of that triple.</p>

  <p> You can use <code>substitute triple</code> to make the <code>find triples</code> block. It  takes one input, a position, and returns the list of  triples that we wanted. Here's a reminder of what's needed:</p>

  <p>This is hard to read, isn't it? Fortunately, we provide a block that helps you read the list.</p>

  <p>Note: triples-converter is used <em><strong>only </strong></em>to help you read the list while debugging; don't use it in the program itself.<br />
